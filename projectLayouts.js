      <p>Every four years, thousands of people across America join together to help elect the next President. While the candidates 
      compete for attention with campaign ads and political sound bites, these dedicated individuals—poll workers, election officials, and 
      volunteers—work behind the scenes to make elections happen. This exhibition brings the service of administering elections into focus 
      through two bodies of work: Greg Miller’s “We the People” and Anna Rotty’s “Poll Work.”</p> 
      
      <p> Spanning two decades, Miller’s photographs document polling places across New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, offering an intimate 
      window into the democratic process. In 2016, Rotty signed up to serve as a poll worker for the San Francisco Department of Elections, initiating a project that 
      reveals the essential contributions of ordinary citizens and honors the range of voices and perspectives represented among those working to ensure that every 
      vote is counted. With the 2024 presidential election on the horizon, these images assert the value and strength of the power of the people.</p>

      <h2>Close Encounters: Facing the Bomb in a New Nuclear Age</h2>

      <p>
          Unfolding across forty-five screens, <em>the bomb</em> immerses viewers in the story of nuclear weapons, 
          from the first nuclear test and subsequent use against Japan by the United States in 1945, to today’s arms race. 
          Using found footage and digital animation, it illuminates the thousands of nuclear arms––held only by nine states––on land, underground, and at sea, 
          many ready for launch. Though largely hidden from view, these weapons pose an ever-present existential threat to humanity.
      </p>
          
      <p>
          Inspired by nuclear weapon command-and-control centers, <em>the bomb</em>’s design evokes the technological fallibility of such systems, 
          the devastating consequences of errors and malfunctions, and the inherent impossibility of ever fully controlling these machines.

      <p>An exhibition of work by Mira Dayal exploring evolving approaches to language as a tool for encryption.</p>

      <p>Through <em>Complex Tokens</em>, Mira Dayal traces the flows and evolutions of language, labor, and technology in society, exploring systems that attempt to map language and cross-historical approaches to encryption. The exhibition is anchored by a series of ink-on-paper drawings of reCAPTCHA texts, digitized words unrecognizable to computers, exposed to further distortions that amplify their refusal to be seen by machines. From these twenty-six drawings, Dayal compiled the “token ID” numbers that OpenAI would use to understand the text, and created the corresponding numbers of clay “tokens,” arranged into grids. These small ovals recall the clay tokens used by ancient Mesopotamian societies to count and record collective holdings of goods and livestock.</p>

      <p>The appearance of cylinder seals advanced ancient administration, creating permanent impressions when rolled across wet clay. The stone seals served bureaucratic purposes akin to authorizing documents or verifying transactions. Dayal has created a series of graphite and chalk cylinder seals with reCAPTCHA texts laser-etched into their forms. The images are reversed and cannot be fully discerned from the seals themselves. Made from drawing materials, the cylinders resemble stone and appear at times organic and at times mass-produced. Because of their fragility, Dayal’s seals cannot be used to make impressions, and thus cannot be entirely decoded.</p>

      <p>Photographs by Evgeniy Maloletka and Mstyslav Chernov documenting the war in Ukraine in early 2022.</p>

      <p class="img-caption">A Ukrainian serviceman takes a photograph of a damaged church after shelling in a residential district in Mariupol, Ukraine, Thursday, March 10, 2022. AP Photo / Evgeniy Maloletka</p>
      <p>On the 24th of February 2022, the Russian Federation commenced a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. An hour before the attack’s apocalyptic beginnings, three Ukrainian journalists from the Associated Press—Evgeniy Maloletka, Mstyslav Chernov, and Vasilisa Stepanenko—arrived in the eastern port city of Mariupol. They had driven through the night, sensing the impending war and painfully aware of the city’s strategic significance for the Kremlin. An industrial center on the coast of the Sea of Azov, Mariupol lies along major routes between Crimea to the west and the border with Russia to the east. In 2014, as fighting erupted in the Donbas, the city was captured briefly by Russian-backed separatists. Ukrainian forces quickly reclaimed Mariupol, but the sounds of war were always near. Eight years later, the violent conflict in the east escalated into catastrophe.</p> 

      <p>Some people evacuated, but many more remained in Mariupol. The city was soon surrounded by Russian forces. Suddenly leaving was impossible. The invaders destroyed the city’s infrastructure, cutting off access to information and disabling the electricity, water, and gas supplies. People drank melted snow and scavenged the city’s remains for food and firewood. The shelling was relentless. Neighbors hid together in basements and improvised bomb shelters. Survivors emerged during breaks in the violence to collect and bury the dead. The bodies of grandmothers and children and friends and sisters and fathers were all placed together in mass graves dug into the frozen ground.</p>

      <p>Presented chronologically in this exhibition, the images by Maloletka and Chernov bear witness to the destruction wrought on Mariupol at the war’s outset. The AP photographers were the only international media remaining in the city under siege, the only journalists able to transmit video and still photographs during the first weeks of the blockade. When Russian troops entered the city, they knew what would happen if they were caught. They had to get themselves, and their footage, out. On March 15, alongside thousands of civilians, the team escaped Mariupol through a “green corridor” that had finally been opened. There was no telling when, or if, they would ever return.</p> 

      <p>As the war pushes on, these photographs fight against forgetting. They speak for the agony of Mariupol, carrying forward evidence of the violence inflicted upon the city’s people, confronting the world with the incomprehensible terror of what happened. The siege ended after more than eighty days. Mariupol has been occupied by Russia since May 2022.</p>

      <p>Video is everywhere today—on our phones and screens, defining new spaces and experiences, spreading memes, lies, fervor, and power. 
      Shared, sent, and networked, it shapes public opinion and creates new publics. In other words, video has transformed the world. Bringing 
      together a diverse range of work from the past six decades, <em>Signals</em> reveals the ways in which artists have posed video as an agent of 
      global change—from televised revolution to electronic democracy.</p>

      <p>The exhibition highlights over 70 media works, drawn primarily from MoMA’s collection, with many never before seen at the Museum. 
      Featured artists include John Akomfrah, Gretchen Bender, Dara Birnbaum, Tony Cokes, Amar Kanwar, New Red Order, Nam June Paik, Sondra Perry, 
      Martine Syms, Stan VanDerBeek, and Ming Wong. <em>Signals</em> enables audiences to experience video art’s wildly varied formats, settings, and 
      global reach, from closed-circuit surveillance to viral video, from large-scale installation to social networks.</p>

      <p>With this broad range of forms and media, artists have championed and questioned the promise of video. Some have hoped to create 
      entirely new networks of communication, democratic engagement, and public participation. Others have protested the rise of commercial 
      and state control over information, vision, and truth itself. <em>Signals</em> focuses on the ways in which artists have used video to ask urgent
       questions about society and propose new models of public life.</p>

      <p>We have finally entered 2021. But we are still roiled by a global pandemic, an unprecedented election cycle, and mass protests 
      in the United States. The inauguration of the nation’s 46th president is upon us, following a horrific homegrown attack on the US 
      Capitol that was livestreamed on countless screens. We watched the insurrection unfold on our phones and laptops and TVs in real time; 
      we watched a violent assault on democracy fomented in the virtual sphere. One thing seems undeniable: the domination of politics by 
      media, and most of all by video. From the split screen of two Americas, of those in power and those powerless, to the viral videos 
      that shape our beliefs and our actions, video has seemingly seeped into every aspect of our lives.</p>

      <p>This sea-change has been brewing for years: a reality-TV president, war as a video game, bodycam footage, endless Zoom meetings, 
      the rise of TikTok. What seems especially new is the degree of our dependence; video is the medium through which we conduct every 
      moment of our lives—from quarantined parties to business meetings to political debates to policing. And it has become clear that 
      video is a network that might connect and unite, but that might also shatter and radicalize. Drawn primarily from MoMA’s collection, 
      the selection of works takes on the newly omnipresent impact of video on politics, on the cusp of world change.</p>

      <p>Artists have created some of the most prescient and perceptive takes on this media transformation. This online screening presented an 
      international selection of artists’ experiments that still feel uncannily relevant to our relationship with video today. What are the conditions 
      that brought us to this point, and where might we go from here? With <strong>Artur Żmijewski’s <em>Democracies</em> (2009)</strong>, we consider the 
      performance of politics in public space, while <strong>Bani Abidi’s <em>RESERVED</em> (2006)</strong> presents a sharp study of official ceremony. 
      The decades of presidential campaign ads collected by <strong>Antoni Muntadas and Marshall Reese in <em>Political Advertisement X: 1952–2020</em> (2020)</strong>, 
      continually updated to this day, reveals the evolution of the televisual language used to influence and even create political power. 
      We see video as a tool of persuasion and propaganda, but also as a means of witnessing and resistance. Together, the videos echo the 
      question posed by the title of this series—democracies?—exploring the endlessly multiple and fractured publics within which we now live.</p>

      <p>
          Today, when technology seems utterly smooth and weightless—composed of invisible waves, wireless signals, 
          abstract codes—<em>New Order</em> explores the ways in which these systems are still stubbornly tied to the physical 
          world. Drawn entirely from MoMA’s collection, the works included highlight the uneasy coexistence of 
          intelligent networks and dumb stuff, high tech and raw material, the fabricated and the readymade. Technology, 
          they suggest, is always mired in matter, friction, and failure.
      </p>

      <p>
          Presenting a number of recent acquisitions and large-scale installations never before shown at the Museum, 
          the exhibition showcases a diverse range of techniques and media, from live digital simulation to industrial 
          vacuum-formed plastic to ultrasound gel. These pieces revel in the weird and unexpected, giving rise to hybrid 
          constellations of things and bodies and data.
      </p>

      <p>
          <em>New Order</em> looks at the ways in which contemporary artists use—and misuse—tools and forms. The show features works 
          made since the turn of the millennium that push and challenge the boundaries of technology: upending systems, 
          experimenting with materials, and ultimately inventing novel techniques and substances.
