            <p>I am a researcher and curator with more than a decade of experience working at the nexus of art, 
            technology, and communication.</p>
            <p>I have held positions at institutions including The Museum of Modern Art, Princeton University, and <em>Artforum</em>. 
            <p>My practice is grounded in a desire to explore experimental forms and 
            networks of collective creation, particularly those emerging outside traditional frameworks.</p>

            <p>I am excited to explore collaborations and conversations, with a particular interest in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contemporary art</li>
                <li>Blockchain / web3</li>
                <li>Creative approaches to human–AI cooperation</li>
                <li>Pirate media networks</li>
            </ul>
